# Jawn Games

Jawn Games is a custom sports tracking application. It is meant to track a variety of sports played by a large group of players. It promotes good sportsmanship, friendly competition, and straight up having fun with friends. Of course winning is still important, but the idea behind Jawn Games is to be inclusive of friends that might not be good at games. 

Jawn Games is at its best when used for large gatherings where a variety of sports and/or games are available to participate in. Like an extended family BBQ or family reunion, a bacheler party, a company event, or really any outing where people should mingle, have fun, and get their game on. 

Instead of just tracking and awarding points for wins, Jawn Games gives players points for a variety of things. Points are awarded for:

1. Each win = 1 pt
2. Each game you play = 1 pt
3. Each time you play a new sport / game = 1 pt
4. Each time you play a game with a different teammate (assuming games are 2v2) = 1 pt

At the end of the day with Jawn Games, the winner of the day isn't the person that won the most games. It's the person that PLAYED the most. 

That's what it's all about. 

NOTE: This is the beta verson of Jawn Games. Version 2.0 is under construction and being built in Reach Native as a mobile app.
