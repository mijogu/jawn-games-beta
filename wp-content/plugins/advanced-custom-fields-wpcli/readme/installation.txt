= Requirements =

* Advanced Custom Fields 5 Pro plugin
* `wp-cli` http://wp-cli.org/

= How to install =

Install WP-CLI as described on [http://wp-cli.org/](http://wp-cli.org/ "WP-CLI")

Using composer:
```
composer require wpackagist-plugin/advanced-custom-fields-wpcli
```

By GIT clone in plugins directory:
```
git clone https://github.com/hoppinger/advanced-custom-fields-wpcli.git
```

WordPress plugin installation:
Download zip and put the files in the plugins directory.

* Activate this plugin in the plugin menu or using:
```
wp plugin activate advanced-custom-fields-wpcli
```

Go the wordpress directory in your terminal and run:
```
wp acf
```
To see if everything is working correctly.

When the plugin is enabled, any exported field groups found on the filesystem in your registered paths will be added to Wordpress at runtime.
If you would like to disable this behaviour you can remove the `acf_wpcli_register_groups` action:
```
remove_action('plugins_loaded', 'acf_wpcli_register_groups');
```
